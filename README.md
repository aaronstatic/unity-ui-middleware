Unity UI Middleware (UUM)
=====

A data-aware middleware for Unity UI Toolkit

Motives
-----
- Data binding in a clever way and without any coding on the UI side, data packets could be passed down the scene heirarchy kinda like react
- Routing, ie click this button open this page, maybe taking from next.js
- Some "widgets" and custom controls to facilitate both of the above and extend core ones, things like list views, tables etc
- Event system, again without need for coding (unless you really need to)
- A simple in-memory database system (with the ability to connect to other databases) and the ability to save/load. Could technically use this for both game data and U
